# Coffee Analysis
Used pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn and statsmodels to perform EDA, clean, model, and visualize data from over 7000 reviews of coffee beans 
to determine which factors most contribute to a highly-rated and high-priced cup of coffee.  
Performed linear regression modeling. Used Tableau to create a story with several dashboards and visualizations to answer business questions.
